# Python
CS3012 assignment submission in Python for both LCA and DAG


 <i><b>Explanation of the LCA</b></i>

 The lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes v and w in a tree is the lowest node that has both v and w as descendants.

 Some of the tests I look for include:

 <b>Tests</b>

 1. Check for the lowest common ancestory
 2. Test the constructor
 3. Test a null tree
 4. Test for duplicates
 5. Test when only one node
 6. Test 'get' 
 7. Test height of tree
 8. Test for non standard characters
